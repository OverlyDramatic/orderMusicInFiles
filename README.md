# Order Music In Files

---

## Order your music by albums and anything else in files

---

I made it in my Scarce free time.

This thing was started when I found I run out my cell phone's storage, and I have to transfer my  music files (20G+)  to a sony recorder which can provide me a hifi experience.

I did not have much time for these 2000+ music files. So I thought this is the time to let my computer to do the job.

This is a very early version and I will upgrade this project when I am free from 996, my master's thesis and job hunting. I will optimize its performance I promise. 

This project will not only be a file copy stuff. I will build it a music file management system, and give it a GUI and log management feature.

## How to use the stuff

I will made it a good npm package, but you can only download this shis now. Sorry for that.
